# üíº Django HR Agency Platform

A web-based platform built with **Django**, designed for HR agencies to manage operations, user roles, and intelligent communication in one place.

---

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ **Django Admin Panel**  
- Manage users, companies, and candidates through a robust admin interface.
- Permissions control who can access different data and features.

---

‚úÖ **Real-Time Chat System (Long Polling)**  
- Integrated chat feature supporting:
  - Sending and receiving messages in near real-time.
  - Selecting who can participate in each chat conversation.

> **About Long Polling:**  
> Long polling is a technique that allows real-time updates without using WebSockets. Instead of constantly sending rapid requests, the client sends one request and waits until the server has new data to return. Once a message arrives, the server responds, and the client immediately sends a new request, achieving real-time communication while keeping the implementation simpler.

---

‚úÖ **AI Chat Assistant via OpenRouter API**  
- Users with admin panel permissions can interact with an AI chatbot.
- The chatbot is trained on a **knowledge base** relevant to the HR domain.
- Use cases include:
  - Helping HR staff answer questions.
  - Automating candidate conversations.
  - Providing instant insights for companies.

‚úÖ **Flexible User Roles**

Your application supports these roles:

| Role                  | Description                                                |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Superuser**         | Full access and management capabilities.                   |
| **HR Agency Employee**| Agency staff managing candidates and companies.            |
| **Company**           | Represents a company entity using the agency services.     |
| **Company Employee**  | Employees belonging to a specific company.                 |
| **Candidate**         | Individuals seeking jobs through the HR agency.            |

---

‚úÖ **Proxy User Models**

- All user types extend the Django `auth.User` model using **proxy models**:
  - Candidate
  - Agency Employee
  - Company Employee

This approach allows:
- Managing all users under a single **Accounts** section.
- Displaying both shared user fields (username, email, etc.) and role-specific details (e.g. candidate profile info) in the admin panel.

---

‚úÖ **Login with Username or Email**

- Users can log in with either their **username or email address** for greater convenience.
